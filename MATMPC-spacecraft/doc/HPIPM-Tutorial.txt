This is a tutorial for installing BLASFEO and HPIPM on Windows 64-bit system. BLASFEO is a linear algebra library and HPIPM is a sparse QP solver.

Since they are developed in Linux systems, first you need to install the GCC compiler "mingw64" and the linux environment "msys" .

1. Download "mingw64" from http://www.mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds. The website will lead you to Sourceforge repository where the installer will be automatically downloaded.
2. Open the installer. It is recommended to install mingw64 in disk D: or above (disk C: may have problem with the Administration account). Choose the configuration as follows: 
    1) GCC version=compatible with the MATLAB version (e.g. 6.3.0 for MATLAB R2020); 2) threads=posix; 3) exceptions=seh; 4) arch = x86_64; 5) rev = latest (biggest number). 
3. add "D:\msys64\bin" and "C:\msys64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin" into system's environment path (not user path)
4. open a windows command window by using "cmd", type "gcc -v", if you get information about your gcc version, then you have installed mingw64 successfully.
5. Open the MATMPC folder in MATLAB, run "configuremingw" and select the mingw64 folder you just installed. You must see mingw64 successfully configured for MATLAB.
6. Download "msys" from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/MSYS%20%2832-bit%29/. Choose the "MSYS-20111123.zip".
7. Unzip the downloaded "msys" folder and add "msys/bin" to system's environment path.


Now we can install BLASFEO and HPIPM.

1. download BLASFEO and HPIPM from https://github.com/chenyutao36/blasfeo and https://github.com/chenyutao36/hpipm
2. go to the BLASFEO directory, open Makefile.rule using a text editor
3. select "TARGET="  according to your CPU architecture (if not sure, use X64_INTEL_CORE if you have a INTEL CPU)
4. uncomment "OS=WINDOWS" for the operating system
5. choose C Compiler as "CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
6. Change the Installation directory to your desired path (recommend NOT to install in Disk C:)
7. open a command terminal at the current location
8. type "make" and run
9. type "make install_static" and run

9. go to the HPIPM directory, open Makefile.rule using a text editor
10. Change the "BLASFEO installation directory" to the exact path in which BLASFEO has been installed
11. do the same thing as in steps 4 to 8

OK we are done! Let's compile mexFunction in MATMPC

1. Open Matlab and go to MATMPC/mex_core
2. open compile_hpipm.m
3. Click Run and you should have hpipm_sparse.mexw64, hpipm_pcond.mexw64

In Simulation.m, try

1. opt.condensing = 'blasfeo_full', run simulations and it should be faster in terms of COND time than 'default_full'
2. opt.condensing = 'no', opt.qpsolver = 'hpipm_sparse' or 'hpipm_pcond', the time for solving QP should be much less.

Good luck!
